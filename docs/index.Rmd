Hello! My name is Bo Han and I am a third year Statistics and Data Science student. I go to Acts Fellowship Church here in Austin, and I serve as an evangelism and small group leader. In the picture above, I was in Guatemala, where my church and I went on a mission trip to share the Gospel! I enjoy playing sports like football and spikeball and playing chess.

#### My Favorite Movies:
1. The Fantastic Mr. Fox
2. The Batman
3. A Silent Voice
